Lightweight desktop environment 
Me, jos, klaas

Aims: 
* Meet end-users changing needs
** Lots of app choice and preferences
** Just enough desktop
* Meet providers' needs
** Less to maintain and support
** One code base for lightweight and fullfat cases

Background: 
* KDE configurable, modular, heavy by default
* Lightweight alternatives start from scratch, getting heavier, reinvent wheels
* Exploit C&M to shrink KDE

How:
* Small footprint - Split packages, weak dependencies
* Simple configuration
* Fast startup

Results
* Package repository and pattern - smaller installed footprint 
* Configuration profiles - 50% smaller memory footprint, simpler UI
* Systemd native KDE user session - 30% faster login, more savings possible
