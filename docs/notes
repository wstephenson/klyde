lkowyde effort

Reduce memory footprint of default desktop
  Reduce login time?
    About 6s to login either way, interestingly logout is 4s/1.5s cut down.
Reduce disk footprint of installed packages

Notes/questions?
* What causes kio_file x2, kio_trash and kio_desktop to be launched on login?
    2nd activity with desktop folderview containing trash?
    kio_trash: kickoff's trash item, and something else: ask coolo or dfaure how to track KIO requester
    kio_desktop: desktop folderviews

!kde-workspace/ksmserver/README

startkde
* is LD_BIND_NOW still a win?
* what does the sed check for out of PATH start cost?
* document that after ksmserver is started, the desktop is logged in and running until logout begins
*/usr/shutdown derived from libdir is a useless prefix for kde shutdown scripts
* disable kde4-migrate call now, except on SLE
* remove krandrrc stuff when afiestas' stuff lands
* startupconfigkeys stuff setups up config files that are evaluated by kcminit
* startup states documented in kde-workspace/ksplash/README
* distinction between kdeinit4, klauncher and kwrapper4?
  * kdeinit launches kded and klauncher, and launches KDE processes by forking itself.  setuid to prevent OOM killing.  whatdoes kdeinit_library_path do? seems like it used to initialise lt_dl searchpath, but this was commented out in 2006 and now it only generates the kwrapper socket path using DISPLAY
  * klauncher is a dbus service started by kdeinit.  It commands kdeinit over a local socket pair.  It is for starting other services (by desktop file) and ioslaves (by protocol/host) (incl in debug/vg mode), ioslave manager (recycles idle ioslaves, puts on hold, kills after timeout). Service activation uses appearance of dbus service to detect completed launch.  Manages startup notifications. Applies Kiosk restrictions to service requests.  Performs autostart under the control of ksmserver.
  * all source is in kdelibs/kinit.
  kwrapper4 causes a program to be launched by kdeinit4
* is kcminit still used
  * kde-workspace/kcminit
  * kaccess is started by its kcm's kcminit function
* autostart documentation is in kdelibs/kinit for klauncher.
* Minimalistic ksplashqml disappears later than ksplashx

KSplash includes some Qt sources which may be stale.  They are modified to work without QApplication, perhaps later refactorings in Qt render these redundant.

KSplash Startup states:
===============

These are ksplash states:
- initial - at the beginning
- kded - after kded is running (dbus is ready, etc.)
- confupdate - after kconf_update (settings updated after upgrade, etc.)
- kcminit - after configuration setup
- ksmserver - session manager is started
- wm - window manager is running
- desktop - desktop (plasma) is running
- ready - session is ready (not fully actually, still e.g. restoring applications, but splash goes away)

Note however that these states should not be relied on too much:
- they do not represent very accurately what is actually going on
- states may be removed (they'll take 0 time and directly go to another state)
- states may be added
- states may be reordered (waiting for a later state and then a sooner state means the sooner state will take 0 time)
"

 
Requirements (trying not to include ksmserver here but its effects)
login snd->
	   session-restore->
	    user autostart->
		    plasma->kwin->?(session-state)       ->(ex-session-state)->kded0->kcminit0->->kdeinit->kstartupconfigkeys
						  ->kded1
			   kded2->
			kcminit2->
			
Does keys kcm still have a kcminit function.  Also emoticons seems to no longer use kcminit

Packaging changes
+++++++++++++++++

Big picture stuff to split
--------------------------
Akonadi -> pim-runtime
Nepomuk -> -semantic packages
Attica -> -social
Activities -> activities

Plasmoid remoting?
Runners (see below)
Plasma-netbook -> netbook
      -> extra

DONE split out nepomuk from kdebase4-runtime
python-kde4 requires akonadi-runtime
  split python-kde4 into python-kde4-akonadi, requires akonadi-runtime and py apps that use it can require that

Activities
----------
Panel Applet (DONE)
Desktop menu
Desktop context menu
window menu
make kactivities4 Recommended only in kdebase4-workspace
Switch Activity desktop mouse actions

Systemsettings
--------------	
Definitely:

kcm_kresources -> kdekpimlibs4
kcm_attica in kdebase4-runtime
kcm_emoticons 
kcm_bell
kcmlaunch
Ensure notifications notifyrc files are split too
powerdevilactivitiesconfig.desktop
kcm_polkit*.desktop

Consider removing configurability by taking out eg style, kdm kcms?

Widget styles *
-------------
./apps/kstyle/themes/*.themerc
No point removing these as kcm_style still shows the builtin Qt themes without them, just without description.

Solid NetworkManagement backends
--------------------------------
All except NM09

Menu clearup
============
Sorting?
Sorting in kmenuedits as long as you place things after, NOT before, something else -> BUG.

xterm needed by default?

Existing work
=============
rule-project.org (defunct, use archive.org)
kubuntu low fat

Remove laggy animation tracking plasma widget item under mouse?

Lisann's feedback
=================
Tidy up menus
Design (icon in folderview text spacing)
Don't assume generalisation of personal tastes.
No point reducing things that people set up once
Is there a way to set things up once then hide things (modal setup)
Figure out the things that people have to face frequently and optimise there.

and this must pull in soprano-backend-virtuoso

Stuff pulled in by pattern with zypper in -t pattern --no-recommends KDE4-KLYDE:
kactivities4
kdepimlibs4
Probably still pulled in by kdebase4-workspace 4.8.1 as 4.8.2 in klyde has none of its deps available - aggregate?

split out konq components needed by rekonq?
DONE kdelibs r424 adds spurious runtime requires because of rpmlint
libphonon4 requires libqzeitgeist0 - runtim components from where?
kio_http_cache_cleaner does not terminate
DONE kaccess does not terminate

kcm_kded crashes if a disabled stopped service is enabled THEN started
because selection is cleared by enabling service but button is not disabled

disable krunner plugins?

kwin tabbox allocates 3MB extra on first alt-tab.
