Work around configuration, including simplified configuration UIs and metadata

simplersystemsettings: metadata for a reduced set of system settings modules. requires a patched systemsettings (in OBS)

profiles: sets of config files giving a klyde setup
We document our policy for changing defaults inline in the config files using hash comments in the following format

# KLYDE SETTING REASON
KLYDE tags the comment as relating to Klyde config

SETTING=OFF|ON|NOPOLICY
OFF/ON are syntactic sugar for enabled/disabled/true/false, whatever the config file expects
NOPOLICY specifies that we do not set a policy for this setting, and is included so the reason for not providing policy must be given.  It should be followed by the commented out config group/field that no policy is being set for, to make the explicit lack of policy for this item clear

REASON=OPT-IN|OPT-OUT|INSTALLATION-DEFAULT
OPT-IN User should opt in to this setting
OPT-OUT User needs to opt out of this settings (essential things)
INSTALLATION-DEFAULT explains that NOPOLICY is used to allow the default setting resulting from installing the package to be taken.
